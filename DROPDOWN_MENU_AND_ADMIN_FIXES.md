**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

2. Employer portal user dropdown menu buttons not functional

## üîß Issue 1: Admin Panel - Employer Management

### Problem
Admin panel's employer management page was throwing a 500 error when trying to fetch employers.

**Error:**
```
‚ùå [ADMIN] GET /api/admin/employers?limit=100 {}
Status: 500
```

### Root Cause
The `getAllEmployers` function in `adminController.js` was counting jobs with `status: 'active'`, but the valid job status in the database is `'approved'`.

```javascript
// WRONG
empObj.activeJobs = await Job.count({ 
  where: { employer_id: employer.id, status: 'active' } 
});

// CORRECT
empObj.activeJobs = await Job.count({ 
  where: { employer_id: employer.id, status: 'approved' } 
});
```

### Fix Applied
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/adminController.js`

Changed line 173 from:
```javascript
empObj.activeJobs = await Job.count({ where: { employer_id: employer.id, status: 'active' } });
```

To:
```javascript
empObj.activeJobs = await Job.count({ where: { employer_id: employer.id, status: 'approved' } });
```

### Result
‚úÖ Admin panel employer management now loads successfully  
‚úÖ Shows correct employer data with job counts  
‚úÖ Displays employer profiles and verification status

## üîß Issue 2: Employer Portal - User Dropdown Menu

### Problem
When clicking the user icon in the top-right corner of the employer portal, the dropdown menu showed these options:
- Profile Settings
- Company Settings
- Billing & Payments
- Logout from HireHub

**However**, only the "Logout" button worked. The other three buttons did nothing when clicked.

### Root Cause
The dropdown menu items had no `onClick` handlers. They were just text placeholders:

```jsx
<DropdownMenuItem>Profile Settings</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem>Company Settings</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem>Billing & Payments</DropdownMenuItem>
```

### Fix Applied

#### 1. Updated Dashboard Component
**File:** `Frontend/employer-connect-pro-main/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

Passed the `onTabChange` prop to the Header component:

```tsx
// Before
<Header />

// After
<Header onTabChange={setActiveTab} />
```

#### 2. Updated Header Component
**File:** `Frontend/employer-connect-pro-main/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Changes:**

1. **Added interface for props:**
```tsx
interface HeaderProps {
  onTabChange?: (tab: string) => void;
}

export function Header({ onTabChange }: HeaderProps) {
```

2. **Added icon imports:**
```tsx
import { UserCircle, Building, CreditCard } from "lucide-react";
```

3. **Added onClick handlers and icons:**
```tsx
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => onTabChange?.('profile')}>
  <UserCircle className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Profile Settings
</DropdownMenuItem>

<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => onTabChange?.('profile')}>
  <Building className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Company Settings
</DropdownMenuItem>

<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => onTabChange?.('payments')}>
  <CreditCard className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  Billing & Payments
</DropdownMenuItem>
```

### Menu Item Mappings

| Menu Item | Tab | Page Component |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Profile Settings | `'profile'` | `ProfilePage` |
| Company Settings | `'profile'` | `ProfilePage` (same as Profile) |
| Billing & Payments | `'payments'` | `PaymentsPage` |
| Logout | N/A | Logs out and redirects to Auth Hub |

**Note:** Both "Profile Settings" and "Company Settings" navigate to the same Profile page, where employers can edit both their personal profile and company information.

### Result
‚úÖ All dropdown menu items now functional  
‚úÖ Profile Settings ‚Üí Opens employer profile page  
‚úÖ Company Settings ‚Üí Opens employer profile page  
‚úÖ Billing & Payments ‚Üí Opens payments page  
‚úÖ Added icons for better UX  
‚úÖ Logout continues to work as before

## üéØ Benefits

### For Admins:
- Can now properly view and manage employers
- See accurate job statistics per employer
- Verify or reject employer registrations

### For Employers:
- Easy access to profile settings from any page
- Quick navigation to payments without using sidebar
- Improved user experience with icons
- Consistent dropdown menu behavior

## üìù Notes

- **Profile vs Company:** Both menu items currently go to the same page. In the future, you could create a separate company settings page if needed.
- **Payment History:** The payments page shows payment history and allows employers to manage subscriptions.
- **Backward Compatible:** The optional `onTabChange` prop means the Header component won't break if used elsewhere without the prop.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes:**
   ```bash
   .\start-hirehub.bat
   ```

2. **Verify both issues are resolved:**

3. **Consider future enhancements:**
   - Add separate "Company Settings" page
