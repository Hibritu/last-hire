# ‚úÖ Employer Signup & Profile Issue - FIXED

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Employer signup not saving name/profile data, requiring email verification  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

## üêõ The Problems

### Problem 1: Email Verification Required
The unified backend was **requiring email verification** before allowing login. After signup:
- Backend sent an OTP to your email
- You couldn't login without verifying the OTP
- This made testing difficult

### Problem 2: Missing API Endpoints
The unified backend was missing 4 critical endpoints:
- `/api/jobs/categories` ‚ùå
- `/api/jobs/featured` ‚ùå  
- `/api/jobs/search` ‚ùå
- `/api/jobs/employer` ‚ùå

This caused **500 Internal Server Errors** when the frontend tried to fetch job data.

### Problem 3: Profile Data Not Loading
The employer frontend was falling back to **mock data** because:
- API endpoints were missing (causing errors)
- Backend availability check was failing
- Frontend showed mock employer profile instead of real data

## ‚úÖ The Solutions

### Fix 1: Disabled Email Verification (Development Only)
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

Changed the login function to **skip email verification in development**:

```javascript
// Before: Always required verification
if (!user.is_verified) {
  return res.status(401).json({ 
    error: 'Email not verified...'
  });
}

// After: Only require in production
if (!user.is_verified && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  return res.status(401).json({ 
    error: 'Email not verified...'
  });
}
```

**Result:** You can now login immediately after signup without email verification! ‚úÖ

---

### Fix 2: Added Missing API Endpoints
**Files:**
- `backend/src/controllers/jobsController.js` - Added 4 new functions
- `backend/src/routes/jobs.js` - Added routes

**New Endpoints:**

#### 1. GET `/api/jobs/categories`
Returns 21 job categories with job counts:
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "value": "technology", "label": "Technology", "count": 2 },
    { "value": "programming", "label": "Programming", "count": 1 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### 2. GET `/api/jobs/featured?limit=10`
Returns featured/premium jobs:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Senior Developer",
      "listing_type": "premium",
      "employer": {
        "company_name": "TechCorp"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. GET `/api/jobs/search?location=Ethiopia`
Search/filter jobs (uses same logic as `/api/jobs`):
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 3,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

#### 4. GET `/api/jobs/employer` (Auth Required)
Get jobs for logged-in employer:
```json
{
  "data": [
    // All jobs posted by this employer
  ]
}
```

**Result:** All frontend API calls now work! No more 500 errors! ‚úÖ

---

### Fix 3: Updated Frontend API Configuration
**Files:**
- `Frontend/employer-connect-pro-main/src/lib/api.ts`

Changed API config to use **Vite proxy in development**:

```typescript
// Before: Direct URLs (caused CORS)
AUTH_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:4000',
JOBS_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:4001',

// After: Relative paths in dev (uses proxy)
AUTH_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.DEV ? '' : 'http://localhost:4000',
JOBS_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.DEV ? '' : 'http://localhost:4000',
```

**Result:** No more CORS errors! Frontend connects to backend through proxy! ‚úÖ

## üîê Authentication Flow (Simplified for Development)

### Before (Production Mode):
```
1. User signs up
2. Backend sends OTP to email
3. User must verify email with OTP
4. Only then can user login
```

### After (Development Mode):
```
1. User signs up
2. Backend creates account
3. User can login immediately ‚úÖ
4. Email verification optional
```

**Note:** In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), email verification will still be required for security.

---

## üìä What Data is Saved

When you sign up as an employer, the backend creates:

### 1. User Account (`users` table)
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "email": "employer@example.com",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "role": "employer",
  "phone": "+251912345678",
  "is_verified": false
}
```

### 2. Employer Profile (`employer_profiles` table)
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "user_uuid",
  "type": "individual",
  "company_name": null,
  "sector": null,
  "address": null,
  "phone": null,
  "verification_status": "pending"
}
```

**To complete your profile:**
1. Go to Profile/Settings
2. Fill in:
   - Company Name (required for company type)
   - Address (required)
   - Phone (required)
   - Sector (required for company type)
   - Category (required)
   - TIN Number (required for individual type)
3. Save
