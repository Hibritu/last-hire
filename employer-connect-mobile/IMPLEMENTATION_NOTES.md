## Mock Data Integration
All features use mock data from `mockData.ts`:
- Can be easily removed when backend is integrated
- Services have fallback to mock data when backend unavailable
- Console logs indicate when mock data is being used

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 51
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **Styling**: NativeWind v2.0.11 (TailwindCSS for React Native)
- **Icons**: @expo/vector-icons (Ionicons)
- **State Management**: React Hooks + React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
1. Replace mock data in services with actual API calls
2. Implement real-time messaging with WebSocket/Socket.io
3. Add file upload for chat attachments
4. Implement push notifications for new messages and application updates
5. Add pagination for conversations and applications lists

## Known Limitations (Mock Mode)
- Messages are not persistent (reset on app reload)
- No real-time updates between devices
- Limited to predefined mock conversations
- No message search functionality
- No file attachments in messages
