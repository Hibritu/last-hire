# 🔐 Authentication Token Cross-Port Issue - FIXED

## 🐛 The Root Cause

**localStorage does NOT share across different ports!**

Your HireHub application has multiple frontends on different ports:
- **Auth Hub:** http://localhost:3002
- **Job Seeker Portal:** http://localhost:8081
- **Employer Portal:** http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel:** http://localhost:3001

Each port has its **own separate localStorage**. When a user logs in at the Auth Hub (port 3002), the token is stored in the Auth Hub's localStorage. When they're redirected to the Job Seeker Portal (port 8081), that portal **cannot access** the token because it's in a different localStorage!

### Why This Happened:
1. User logs in at **Auth Hub (port 3002)**
2. Token stored in Auth Hub's localStorage
3. User redirected to **Job Seeker Portal (port 8081)**
4. Job Seeker Portal checks its own localStorage
5. **No token found!** (It's in the Auth Hub's localStorage, not here)
6. When trying to apply, backend returns 401 (Unauthorized)
7. User gets error: "You must be logged in"

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Pass Token via URL Parameter

When redirecting from Auth Hub to another portal, we now pass the token as a URL parameter:

**Before:**
```
http://localhost:8081?from=auth
```

**After:**
```
http://localhost:8081?from=auth&token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Receive and Store Token

Each portal now checks for a token in the URL when it loads:

1. Extract token from URL parameter
2. Store it in the portal's own localStorage
3. Remove token from URL (for security)
4. User is now authenticated in this portal!

---

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### 1. Auth Hub - Pass Token During Redirect

**File:** `Frontend/seekr-companion-main/src/lib/api.ts`

```typescript
// Add token to URL during redirect
const token = tokenManager.get();
const separator = targetUrl.includes('?') ? '&' : '?';
const fullUrl = `${targetUrl}${separator}from=auth${token ? `&token=${encodeURIComponent(token)}` : ''}`;

// Redirect with token
window.location.href = fullUrl;
```

### 2. Job Seeker Portal - Receive Token

**File:** `Frontend/USER(dagi)/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
// Component to handle auth token from URL
const TokenHandler = () => {
  const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const urlToken = searchParams.get('token');
    
    if (urlToken) {
      console.log('🔐 Received token from Auth Hub, storing...');
      tokenManager.set(urlToken);
      
      // Remove token from URL for security
      const newUrl = window.location.pathname + window.location.hash;
      window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, newUrl);
      
      console.log('✅ Token stored successfully');
    }
  }, [searchParams]);
  
  return null;
};
```

### 3. Employer Portal - Receive Token

**File:** `Frontend/employer-connect-pro-main/src/App.tsx`

```typescript
// Check if token is in URL (from Auth Hub redirect)
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const urlToken = urlParams.get('token');

if (urlToken) {
  console.log('🔐 Received token from Auth Hub, storing...');
  tokenManager.set(urlToken);
  
  // Remove token from URL for security
  const newUrl = window.location.pathname + window.location.hash;
  window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, newUrl);
  
  console.log('✅ Token stored successfully');
}
```

### 4. Stop Aggressive Token Clearing

**File:** `Frontend/USER(dagi)/src/lib/api.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (isProtectedAction) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Authentication required');
  tokenManager.clear(); // ❌ Too aggressive!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (isProtectedAction) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Authentication required');
  // DON'T clear token automatically - let component handle redirect
  // tokenManager.clear(); // ✅ Commented out
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Login Fresh
1. Clear all browser data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3002/login**
3. Login with:
   - Email: `seeker@test.com`
   - Password: `123`

### Step 2: Watch Console
During redirect, you should see:
```
🔐 [JOB SEEKER] Received token from Auth Hub, storing...
✅ [JOB SEEKER] Token stored successfully
```

### Step 3: Verify Token is Stored
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('hirehub_token')
```

Should return a JWT token (long string starting with "eyJ...")

### Step 4: Apply to a Job
1. Go to: **http://localhost:8081/jobs**
2. Click on any job
3. Click **"Apply Now"**
4. Fill cover letter (100+ characters)
5. **Submit**

### Expected Result:
```
📤 Submitting application for job: [id]
✅ Application submitted successfully: {...}
```

**Success message:** "Application Submitted Successfully!"

### Step 5: Verify on Backend
As employer:
1. Login: **http://localhost:3000**
   - Email: `test@employer.com`
   - Password: `123`
2. Go to **Applications** tab
3. **You should see the new application!**

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check if Token is Being Passed
1. Login at Auth Hub
2. **Before redirect completes**, check the URL in the address bar
3. You should briefly see: `http://localhost:8081?from=auth&token=eyJ...`
4. Then the token should disappear (removed for security)

### Check Console Logs
**Auth Hub (port 3002):**
```
🔐 [AUTH HUB] Starting login process...
✅ [AUTH HUB] Backend login successful
🚀 [AUTH HUB] Redirecting job_seeker to Job Seeker Portal
🌐 [AUTH HUB] Target URL: http://localhost:8081
```

**Job Seeker Portal (port 8081):**
```
🔐 [JOB SEEKER] Received token from Auth Hub, storing...
✅ [JOB SEEKER] Token stored successfully
```

### Verify Token in localStorage
```javascript
// In Job Seeker Portal (http://localhost:8081)
localStorage.getItem('hirehub_token')
// Should return: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
```

### Test Token with API
```javascript
// In browser console at Job Seeker Portal
fetch('http://localhost:4000/users/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('hirehub_token')}`
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('User data:', data))
```

Should return your user info!

## ✅ Benefits of This Fix

1. **Seamless Authentication:** Users stay logged in across portals
2. **Better UX:** No need to log in multiple times
3. **Secure:** Token removed from URL after extraction
4. **Universal:** Works for all portals (Job Seeker, Employer, Admin)
5. **No Backend Changes:** Pure frontend solution

## 🎯 Related Fixes

### Also Fixed:
1. **Application submission** - Now calls real backend API
2. **Save job feature** - Now persists to database
3. **Aggressive token clearing** - Stopped clearing tokens on 401 errors
4. **Missing imports** - Added `applicationService` to JobDetails
