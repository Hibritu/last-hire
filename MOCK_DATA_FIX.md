# üîß Mock Data Fallback Issue - FIXED

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Frontends were falling back to mock data instead of connecting to the real backend  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

## üêõ The Problem

The frontends (User Portal and Employer Portal) were showing **mock data** instead of real jobs from the backend database because:

### Root Cause
1. **CORS Issues**: Frontend API clients were trying to make **direct HTTP requests** to `http://localhost:4000` from the browser
2. **Bypassing Vite Proxy**: The API configuration was using absolute URLs even in development mode, which bypassed the Vite development proxy
3. **Backend Availability Check Failing**: The `checkBackendAvailability()` function was failing due to CORS, making the app think the backend was down

### What Was Happening
```
Browser (localhost:8081) 
    ‚Üì Direct request
    ‚Üí http://localhost:4000/health ‚ùå CORS ERROR
    ‚Üì Backend check fails
    ‚Üí Falls back to mock data üé≠
```

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

### 1. Updated API Configuration
Changed both frontends to use **relative paths** in development mode, which automatically routes through the Vite proxy:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Frontend/employer-connect-pro-main/src/lib/api.ts
AUTH_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:4000',
JOBS_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.VITE_JOBS_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:4001',
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use relative paths in dev (proxy), absolute in production
AUTH_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.DEV ? '' : (import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:4000'),
JOBS_BASE_URL: import.meta.env.DEV ? '' : (import.meta.env.VITE_JOBS_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:4000'),
```

### 2. Fixed Backend Availability Check
Updated the health check to use the proxy in development:

**Before:**
```typescript
const response = await axios.get(`${serviceUrl}/health`, { timeout: 5000 });
```

**After:**
```typescript
const healthUrl = import.meta.env.DEV ? '/health' : `${serviceUrl}/health`;
const response = await axios.get(healthUrl, { timeout: 5000 });
```

### 3. How It Works Now
```
Browser (localhost:8081)
    ‚Üì Relative request: /health
    ‚Üí Vite Proxy (localhost:8081) 
    ‚Üí Forwards to: http://localhost:4000/health ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì Backend responds
    ‚Üí Real data returned! üéâ
```

   - Created diagnostic page to test API connectivity

3. **All `.env` files** (already updated in previous migration)
   - Pointed to unified backend on port 4000

4. **All `vite.config.ts` files** (already updated)

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Check Services Are Running
```powershell
# Should show all 5 services running
netstat -ano | findstr "4000 3002 8081 3000 3001"
```

### Test 2: API Diagnostic Page
1. Open browser to: **http://localhost:8081/test-api.html**
2. You should see ‚úÖ for all tests
3. It will show the real jobs from the backend

### Test 3: Clear Browser Cache
**IMPORTANT:** You MUST clear browser cache to see changes!

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Ctrl + F5`)

**Option B: Clear Cache**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"

**Option C: Incognito Mode**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Chrome)
- Visit http://localhost:8081

### Test 4: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Jobs backend is available`
   - ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Retrieved jobs from backend`
   - ‚ùå Should NOT see: `üé≠ Using mock data`

### Test 5: Complete Job Flow
1. **Login as Employer** at http://localhost:3002
   - Email: `employer@test.com` / Password: any
2. **Post a Job** at http://localhost:3000
3. **Login as Job Seeker** at http://localhost:3002
   - Email: `seeker@test.com` / Password: any
4. **View Jobs** at http://localhost:8081
   - You should see the job you just posted! ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ What You Should See Now

### User Portal (http://localhost:8081)
```
‚úÖ Real jobs from PostgreSQL database
‚úÖ 3 jobs currently in system:
   1. "string" at hib
   2. "Senior React Developer" at TechCorp Solutions
   3. "Software Developer" at hib
```

### Employer Portal (http://localhost:3000)
```
‚úÖ Real jobs posted by you
‚úÖ Can create new jobs
‚úÖ Jobs appear immediately in Job Seeker portal
‚úÖ Can view real applications
```

### Browser Console Should Show
```javascript
‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Jobs backend is available
‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Retrieved jobs from backend: 3
‚úÖ GET /api/jobs { status: 200, data: [...] }
```

### Browser Console Should NOT Show
```javascript
‚ùå üé≠ [JOB SERVICE] Using mock data
‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend unavailable
‚ùå CORS error
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Vite Proxy Configuration
The Vite proxy is configured in `vite.config.ts` to forward requests:

```typescript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:4000',
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  },
  '/auth': {
    target: 'http://localhost:4000',
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  },
  '/health': {
    target: 'http://localhost:4000',
    changeOrigin: true,
    secure: false,
  },
}
```

### Request Flow
```
1. Frontend JS makes request: fetch('/api/jobs')
2. Vite Dev Server intercepts: localhost:8081/api/jobs
3. Proxy forwards to: http://localhost:4000/api/jobs
4. Backend responds with real data
5. Vite passes response back to frontend
6. Frontend receives data (no CORS issues!)
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Seeing Mock Data
**Solution:** Clear browser cache!
```
1. Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Clear "Cached images and files"
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
```

### Issue 2: "Backend unavailable" in console
**Solution:** Restart services
```powershell
# Stop all
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force

# Restart
start-hirehub.bat
```

### Issue 3: CORS errors in console
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct URL
```
‚úÖ Correct: http://localhost:8081 (goes through proxy)
‚ùå Wrong:   http://localhost:4000 (direct, causes CORS)
```

### Issue 4: 404 errors
**Solution:** Verify backend is running
```powershell
# Test backend directly
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4000/api/jobs"
```

## üìä Before vs After

### Before (Using Mock Data)
```
- Frontend sees mock jobs only
- Jobs don't persist after refresh
- Can't see jobs posted by others
- Applications don't actually submit
- Console shows: "üé≠ Using mock data"
```

### After (Using Real Backend)
```
‚úÖ Frontend sees real jobs from PostgreSQL
‚úÖ Jobs persist in database
‚úÖ Job seekers see jobs posted by employers
‚úÖ Applications are saved to database
‚úÖ Console shows: "‚úÖ Retrieved jobs from backend"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Unified backend running on port 4000
- [x] All frontends configured to use unified backend
- [x] Vite proxies configured correctly
- [x] API config uses relative paths in development
- [x] Backend availability check uses proxy
- [x] `.env` files point to port 4000
- [x] Services restart successfully
- [x] API returns real data (not mock)
- [x] Browser can access jobs through proxy

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ **Browser Console Shows:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Jobs backend is available
   ‚úÖ GET /api/jobs { status: 200, data: [Array] }
   ‚úÖ [JOB SERVICE] Retrieved jobs from backend: 3
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Jobs Page Shows:**
   - Real jobs from database
   - Company names like "TechCorp Solutions", "hib"
   - NOT generic mock names like "Tech Corp" or "Startup Inc"

3. ‚úÖ **You Can:**
   - Post a job as employer
   - See it immediately in job seeker portal
   - Apply to jobs
   - View applications in employer dashboard

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you're still seeing mock data after:
1. ‚úÖ Restarting all services
2. ‚úÖ Clearing browser cache  
3. ‚úÖ Hard refreshing (Ctrl+Shift+R)

Then run the diagnostic:
```
Open: http://localhost:8081/test-api.html
```

If all tests pass ‚úÖ but you still see mock data, it's a caching issue.
Try using **Incognito/Private browsing mode** to test with a clean slate.

---

## üìù Summary

**The Fix:** Changed API configuration to use Vite proxy in development instead of direct HTTP requests, which eliminates CORS issues and ensures the frontend always connects to the real backend.

**Result:** Frontends now successfully connect to the unified backend and display real data from PostgreSQL! üéâ

**Next:** Clear your browser cache and test at http://localhost:8081 üöÄ
