# üêõ BUG FIXED: Job Applications Now Save to Database!

## The Problem
The job application form was **simulating** submissions instead of actually sending them to the backend. It showed a success message but **never saved to the database**.

## The Fix
‚úÖ **Applications now call the REAL backend API**
‚úÖ **Saved to database immediately**
‚úÖ **Employers can see them instantly**

## üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Simulate API call
setTimeout(() => {
  setHasApplied(true);
  toast({ title: "Application Submitted!" });
}, 2000);
```
**Result:** Nothing saved to database ‚ùå

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Submit application to backend
const result = await applicationService.applyToJob(id!, {
  cover_letter: coverLetter.trim(),
  applicant_name: applicantName.trim(),
  applicant_email: applicantEmail.trim()
});
console.log('‚úÖ Application submitted:', result);
```
**Result:** Saved to database immediately ‚úÖ

### Backend Endpoint:
```

Authorization: Bearer [token]
Body: { cover_letter, applicant_name, applicant_email }
```

### Database Record Created:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
